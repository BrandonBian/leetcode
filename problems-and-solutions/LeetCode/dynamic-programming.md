# Problem List According to [This LeetCode Post](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns)
## Minimum (Maximum) Path to Reach a Target

- **Statement**

```
Given a target find minimum (maximum) cost / path / sum to reach the target.
```

- **Approach**

```
Choose minimum (maximum) path among all possible paths before the current state, then add value for the current state.

>> routes[i] = min(routes[i-1], routes[i-2], ... , routes[i-k]) + cost[i]
```
