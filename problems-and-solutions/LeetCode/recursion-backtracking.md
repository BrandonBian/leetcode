## Recursion & Backtracking Problems | [[Study Guide](https://github.com/BrandonBian/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/algorithms/recursion-backtracking.md)] | [[Solutions](https://github.com/BrandonBian/LeetCode-Notes/blob/main/problems-and-solutions/LeetCode/binary-search-solutions.md)]

- **UTMOST MUST DO Problems - Base Problems**:

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [77. Combinations](https://leetcode.com/problems/combinations/): (**Backtracking for Combinations**)

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [39. Combination Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/): (**Backtracking for Combination Sum**)

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [46. Permutations](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations/): (**Backtracking for Permutations**)

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [78. Subsets](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets/): running combinations for lengths from [0, len(nums)] (**Backtracking for Subsets / Power Set**)

- **Variation of Base Problems**:

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [47. Permutations II](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutations-ii/): elements in given number array may not be unique, need to **remove duplicates**

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [90. Subsets II](https://leetcode.com/problems/subsets-ii/): elements in given number array may not be unique, need to **remove duplicates**

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [40. Combination Sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-ii/): need to **remove duplicates**, each number can only be used once

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [216. Combination Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iii/): fixed length, each number can only be used once

- **Harder & More Varied Core Problems**:

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/letter-combinations-of-a-phone-number/)

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [22. Generate Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/generate-parentheses/)

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [79. Word Search](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search/)

:heavy_check_mark: :orange_book: [131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-partitioning/): a similar method as the DFS template above

:heavy_check_mark: :closed_book: [51. N-Queens](https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/)

:heavy_check_mark: :closed_book: [37. Sudoku Solver](https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/)
